# Surfer Health Survey - A web and mobile application
- Version 1.2

A mobile application built circa 2015 for use in the surfer health survey. The mobile application ran on all mobile platforms at the time, including as a web page. The application has two parts: enrollment and weekly survey. A field worker or individual participant would enroll in the survey and the participant would provide weekly data about their surf sessions and answer health related questions.

The mobile and web application were built using phonegap, backbone, and jquery mobile.
