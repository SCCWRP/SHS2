	"title": "Why is the study <br>being done?",
	"content": "State, local and federal regulatory agencies are interested in determining if there are any links between marine water exposure during the winter, infectious illness, and beach water quality. They are also interested in finding ways to more quickly and accurately determine if there is a health risk to beachgoers due to pathogens in the water. State and local governments have made great strides to improve water quality during the summer months (April - October) when the majority of beachgoers enter the ocean. However, there remains uncertainty about whether ocean exposure during the winter months, when water quality may be worse, poses a public health risk. This will be the first research study to measure the health risks (if any) associated with surfing on the California coast. We hope that the information gained from the research will help inform watershed managers throughout San Diego and the rest of California to help guide investments in the management of storm water runoff.",

	"title": "Where and when will <br>this study take place?",
	"content": " The study will enroll surfers through in-person outreach at Ocean Beach and Tourmaline Surfing Park, and through web-based self-enrollment. The study will begin enrolling surfers in December 2014, and follow them with weekly surveys through March 2015. Surfers enrolled in the study may surf at beaches other than Ocean Beach and Tourmaline during the study period, but the study will focus its water quality testing at these two sentinel beaches.",

	"title": "Why were these areas <br>selected for this study?",
	"content": "San Diego County has some of the most heavily used beaches in the state of California during the winter months due in large part to its vibrant, year-round surfing community. The study decided to focus its in-person recruitment and water quality testing at Ocean Beach and Tourmaline Surfing Park because they are located in San Diego County, they both attract a large, year-round surfing population, and they both have storm water discharges to the surf zone.",
